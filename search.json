    "text": "Course Overview\nForecasting is a valuable tool that allows organizations to make informed decisions about the future. Time series forecasting, in particular, uses historical data to predict future trends over time. This technique has extensive applications across a wide range of fields, including finance and economics, health and humanitarian operations, supply chain management, and more. By analyzing trends and patterns in data, time series forecasting can help decision-makers identify potential challenges and opportunities, and plan accordingly.\nIt is important for researchers in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) to develop technical skill in data analysis and forecasting techniques, which are essential for accurate and reliable forecasting. By having these skills, researchers can analyze data, identify trends and patterns, and develop robust forecasting models to make informed decisions that can improve resource allocation and planning in LMICs. Additionally, researchers can collaborate with policy makers and stakeholders to ensure that the forecast results are integrated into decision-making processes, leading to more efficient and effective resource management strategies.\nThis workshop is part of the Forecasting for Social Good (F4SG) initiative, and will run online from the 23rd-27th October 2023."
