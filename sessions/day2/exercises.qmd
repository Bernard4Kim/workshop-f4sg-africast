# Learn

Mitch's section to learn the concepts on various datasets

# Apply

In this exercise, you will apply what you have learned so far on a dataset containing doses of administered vaccine in an African country.

## Your turn!
1. Transformation

    - Add later
    
2. Computing features

    - Computer average, standard deviation and coefficient of variation (cv) for the monthly time series 
    - Compute all features for 9 monthly time series corresponding to vaccine doses adminstrated in 9 regions
    - Examine the following features and provide an interpretation based on their values:
      - spectral entropy
      - trend
      - seasonality
      - acf1
      - season_acf1
  
3. Visualizing features

    - Create a scatter plot that shows the strength of trend versus strength of seasonality. What information does this plot convey?
    - Which feature indicates how difficult/easy a time series is to forecast? Use that feature to create a distribution usign a boxplot or density plot, how such distribution could be informative?

Using a feature that shows how difficult/easy is to forecast a time series and create a histogram to see the distribution of forecastability
