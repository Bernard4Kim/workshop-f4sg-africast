## Your turn!
1. Decomposition

    - Do an STL decomposition of `dose_adminstrated` for a region of your choice. You will need to choose a trend and seasonal window to allow for the changing shape of these components. How do values of parameters in trend and season changes the decomposition?
    - Plot the components from the STL decomposition.
    - Could you describe the result of the decomposition.
    - Could you produce a seasonally adjusted series and plot them with the dose admonstarted and the trend?
    
2. Computing features

    - Computer average, standard deviation and coefficient of variation (cv) for the monthly time series 
    - Compute all features for 9 monthly time series corresponding to vaccine doses adminstrated in 9 regions
    - Examine the following features and provide an interpretation based on their values:
      - spectral entropy
      - trend
      - seasonality
      - acf1
      - season_acf1
  
3. Visualizing features

    - Create a scatter plot that shows the strength of trend versus strength of seasonality. What information does this plot convey?
    - Which feature indicates how difficult/easy a time series is to forecast? Use that feature to create a distribution of forecastability of time series usign a boxplot or density plot. How such distribution could be informative?
