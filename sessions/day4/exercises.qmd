In this exercise, you use exponetial smoothing and ARIMA models to produce forecasts of future administered vaccine doses for the next 12 months.
:::{.callout-caution}
## ETS
1. Specify and train automatic Exponential Smoothing model

2. Observe the model table and explain what each row and column represent

3. Extract ETS model's output using `report()`, `tidy()`, `glance()`

4. Extract the components of the selected ETS model

5. Generate forecasts using ETS and observe the forecast table

6. Visualize forecasts

7. Use the specific functions to determine manually the components and parameters of ETS models
