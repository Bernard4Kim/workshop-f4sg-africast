In this part, we evaluate the forecast accuracy of all models we have covered so far using a simple train/test split and time series cross validation.

:::{.callout-caution}
## Basic of train/test forecast accuracy
1. Split the data into train and test ensuring the number of months in the test set equals the forecast horizon

2. Specify and train the following models on the train data:

    - Average
    - Naive
    - Seasonal Naive
    - ETS
    - ARIMA
    - Regression with trend and seasonality
    - Regression with trend, seasonality, and population_under1
    - Regression with trend, seasonality, population_under1, and strike
    - Combination of ETS and ARIMA and regression with population and strike

3. Produce forecasts

    - Replace the values of population in the test set with its estimation
    - Produce forecasts for dose adminstrated

4. Compute forecast accuracy including point forecast accuracy, prediction interval and probabilistic forecasts

5. Visualise the forecasts

## Advanced performance evaluation

### Time series cross validation

1. Split the data into test and train

    - the size of test set equals the $20% (30%)$ of the length of the time series
    - the size of test set equals the $80% (70%)$ of the length of the time series

2. Apply time series cross-validation technique to create different time series rolling origins for both the train and test set

3. Replace the values of population in the cross-validated test set with its estimations

4. Specify and train the following models on the cross-validated train dataset:

    - Average
    - Naive
    - Seasonal Naive
    - ETS
    - ARIMA
    - Regression with trend and seasonality
    - Regression with trend, seasonality, and population_under1
    - Regression with trend, seasonality, population_under1, and strike
    - Combination of ETS and ARIMA and regression with population and strike

5. Produce forecasts

6. Compute forecast accuracy including point forecast accuracy, prediction interval and probabilistic forecasts

    - Compute total average forecast accuracy across all orinigs and horizons
    - Compute and visualise forecast accuracy across all horizons for each origin
    - Compute average forecast accuracy across all orinigs for each horizon

7. Specify, train and forecast using the most accurate model and visualise forecast

### Residual diagnostics
1. Extract residuals from the model table from the most accurate model

2. Produce the time plot of residuals from the most accurate model

3. Create the histogram of residuals from the most accurate model

4. Produce the ACF plot of of residuals from the most accurate model
