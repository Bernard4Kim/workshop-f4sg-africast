In this exercise, we first use simple models to produce forecasts of future administered vaccine doses for the next 12 months. Following that, we use regression models to produce such a forecast.

:::{.callout-caution}
## Basic of modelling/forecating
1. Specify and train three simple models including total average, naive and seasonal naive on administered vaccine doses.

2. Examine the model table (`mable`) object and describe what each column and row represent.

3. Use `report()`, `tidy()`, `glance()` and `augment()` to explore the trained model's output.

4. Produce forecasts for 12 months ahead including both point forecast and forecast distribution.

5. Examine the forecast table (`fable`) object and explain what each column and row represent.

6. Visualize the point forecasts alongside past values, as well as prediction interval for $90%$ coverage.

7. Extract prediction intervals for $90%$ coverage.

8. Produce probabilistic forecast using bootstrapping instead of assuming normal distribution. Generate 1000 possible future.

## Forecating using regression
1. Examine the association between `dose_adminstrated` and predictors

    - Assess the association between `dose_adminstrated` and `population_under1`
    - Assess the association between `dose_adminstrated` and `strike`
    - Examine the association between leading predictors of `population_under1` and `dose_adminstrated`

2. Specify and train the four different regression models with the following terms:

    - trensd and seasonality
    - trensd, seasonality, and population_under1
    - trensd, seasonality, population_under1, and strike

3. Examine trained model output using `report()`, `tidy()`, and `glance()` and `augment()`

4. Produce forecast

    - Use `new_data()` to generate future months corresponding to forecast horizon
    - Add future values for the strike
    - Add future values for the population_under1 
    - Generate forecasts for future periods
5. Visualize forecasts
